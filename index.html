        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I am Brandon Rimes, dynamic autodidact and abstract intellectual. I was born in Jupiter, FL 30 years ago under a Scorpio sun, and currently reside in Stuart, FL. My insatiable thirst for knowledge and ‘hit the ground running’ attitude enable me to learn with agility and eloquence. My brain is entertained by intricate puzzles and problems, with a flair for clever design and organic beauty.</p>
        <p>My experience is variegated with professional and recreational endeavors, from technical to interpersonal. I employ a high mechanical aptitude and formal training in communication / therapeutic relations to excel. I perform well individually and as a team member. Leadership and support roles are both comfortable places for me.</p>
        <p>My intention is to apply and advance my computer programming repertoire, creating clean, concise, commented code. I get excited about planet-positive projects that improve our lives and environment (ex. automated reforestation) as well as exquisite user experience web design.</p>
        <p>I enjoy being immersed in nature, gardening, playing various musical instruments, creating ornate objects (furniture, art, tools, etc.), traveling, learning, teaching, connecting with and helping people, and sharing these things with my fellow humans.</p>
